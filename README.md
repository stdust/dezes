# dz6 (Dezes)

**Dezes** is an advanced, high-performance TUI (Terminal User Interface) **Win32 PE Disassembler, Hex Editor, and Software Localization Tool** built in Rust.

It is designed for reverse engineers, binary analysts, and software translators to disassemble x86/x64 executables, edit binary structures, and translate program strings smoothly across multiple encodings.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **PE Binary Disassembler & Analyzer**
  - Full support for PE32 (32-bit) and PE64 (64-bit) Windows executables.
  - Interactive Assembly editing (`F3`), Cross-References / Xref (`Ctrl+R`), and String References (`F5`).

- 🌐 **Software Localization & Translation Suite**
  - **String Scanning (`F6`)**: Multi-encoding string scanning supporting **ASCII**, **UTF-8**, **CP949 (Korean 2-byte ANSI)**, **CP936 (Simplified Chinese)**, and **UTF-16LE**.
  - **In-place String Edit (`F4`)**: Direct string replacement with live encoding budget checks. Defaults to CP949 for immediate Korean translation without text corruption. Cycle target encodings on the fly via `Alt+E`.
  - **Seamless Navigation**: Switch between String Reference (`F5`) and String Scan (`F6`) while preserving search query, filter state, and matching cursor offsets.

- Fast, even when editing large files
- Runs in the terminal / Text User Interface (TUI)
- Vim-like key bindings
- Configurable options
- Edit in hex or ASCII
- String list with regex filtering
- Multiple smart ways to navigate through a file

### From the sources

If you want to test the most recent, but still under development, version of dz6, you'll need [Cargo](https://rustup.rs/) and git, then you can

    git clone https://github.com/mentebinaria/dz6.git
    cd dz6
    cargo install --path .

## Usage

```
Usage: dz6 [OPTIONS] <FILE>

Arguments:
  <FILE>  File to open

Options:
  -o, --offset <OFFSET>  Initial cursor offset (hex default; `t` suffix = decimal) [default: 0]
  -r, --readonly         Set read-only mode
  -h, --help             Print help

If you need permanent settings, create a `$HOME/.dz6init` file containing any of the commands above, one per line. dz6 will load that at startup.

### Hex view

This is the main view you would expect from a hex editor. It displays file offsets alongside the file contents in a hexadecimal dump that you can navigate, search, edit, and more.

#### Calculator

64-bit calculator. Default base is decimal, but you can prefix hex numbers with 0x. Pre-defined variables:

| Variable | Value                       | Length                                                    |
| -------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@x`     | Signed value under cursor   | `x` is `b` (byte), `w` (word), `d` (dword) or `q` (qword) |
| `@X`     | Unsigned value under cursor | `X` is `B` (byte), `W` (word), `D` (dword) or `Q` (qword) |
| `@o`     | Current offset              | dword on 32-bit systems; qword on 64                      |
| `@O`     | Previously visited offset   | same as above                                             |

### Text view

> This view is a work in progress.

The Text view displays the file as plain text. This can be useful even when editing binary files, as it lets you quickly inspect large blocks of text contained within them.

### Header view

> This view is a work in progress.

The header view is a new view (expected in v0.8.0) available for executable files. It parses the executable headers and shows them in a nice way.

## FAQ

**1. I'm on a Mac. How am I supposed to use `Alt` key?!**

iTerm2 users: go to `Settings → Profiles → (your profile) → Keys` and set the `Left Option key` to `Esc+`. This will make the `Option` key work like `Alt`.

**2. Do all Vim commands work in dz6?**

No. Some key bindings behave similarly, but dz6 is not meant to be 100% compatible with Vim. For example, `o` in dz6 moves to the next other byte, while the same key in Vim opens a new line below the current one.

**3. Is dz6 stable yet?**

No. Stability is expected only at v1.0.0. Until then, breaking changes are expected.
